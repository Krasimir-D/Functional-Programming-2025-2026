--types and typeclasses
--Haskell has a static type system which means that the type of every expression and function is known at compile time.
--Haskell has type inference which means that it can figure out the types of expressions and functions on its own.
--If we write a number we don't have to explicitly say that it's a number

--Common types:

--"Int" a 32-bit integer on 32-bit machines. Bounded [-2^31, (2^31)-1]

--"Integer" an integer which is not bounded. Used for larger numbers

--"Float" is a real floating point number with a single precision

--"Double" is a real floating point number with a double precision

--"Bool" is a boolean

--"Char" is a character. They are denoted with signe quotes. Example: 'a'.

--"Tuples" are types, but are dependent on the count of the components and their respective types
